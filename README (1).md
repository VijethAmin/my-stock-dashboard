# 📊 Stock Market Forecasting and Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Introduction
This project is an **interactive dashboard** built with Streamlit for **real-time stock market analysis and forecasting**.  
It integrates **yFinance API** for data, **Plotly** for visualization, and **machine learning models** (ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) for forecasting.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Collect live financial data using yFinance.  
- Provide interactive visualization of stock trends and technical indicators.  
- Forecast stock prices using ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM.  
- Compare models using performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, R², Directional Accuracy).  
- Support multi-stock comparison and portfolio analysis.  
- Deploy on cloud (EC2/Streamlit Cloud).
